# SECURITY INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Copy this file to .env in the same directory
# 2. Replace YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE with your actual API key
# 3. NEVER commit the .env file to version control (it's in .gitignore)
# 4. Keep your API key secure and do not share it publicly
#
# For production deployment, use environment variables or a secrets management service
